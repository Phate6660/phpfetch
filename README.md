# PHPFetch
An info fetch tool written in PHP. Because why not. /shrug<br>
Most likely, not much is going to change. This is pretty much complete.<br>
Unless somebody requests more features or I just feel like adding more.

## Running
- Install PHP
- Clone the repo:
  + `git clone https://github.com/Phate6660/phpfetch && cd phpfetch`
- Run the PHP server:
  + `php -S localhost:8000`
- Open the web page in your browser at `localhost:8000/phpfetch.php`
